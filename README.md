👋 Hello, I'm @SeixasCco

Embarking on a vibrant path within the IT industry, I currently navigate the challenges and rewards as a Delphi Junior Developer and Scrum Master. My journey through code began with a fascination for programming languages, leading me to acquire a diverse skill set that includes proficiency in JavaScript and C#.

👨‍💻 By day, I delve into Delphi, applying my skills to develop and enhance software applications. Embracing the principles of agile methodologies, I also wear the hat of a Scrum Master, guiding teams towards achieving project milestones with efficiency and collaborative spirit.

🌟 My foundation in JavaScript and C# complements my primary roles, allowing me to approach problems with a versatile perspective and contribute across different aspects of development projects.

💞️ I am keen on joining forces with fellow developers, sharing knowledge, and tackling challenges together. Whether it's through contributing to open-source projects or engaging in innovative development endeavors, I am all about applying my skills where they can flourish and learning new ones along the way.
