- 👋 Hi, I’m @SeixasCco
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code programming in JavaScript and Delphi, currently started my long walk with the it industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript at college, beginner, trying to learn from all the sources currently avaliable.
- 🌱 On the side i'm learning Delphi due to maximize all the knowledge about Front and Back End.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things a trainee could help, or anything you're willing to teach me, because i think that the hands on aproach is quite effective.
- 📫 How to reach me - through my personal email raulalves4@gmail.com or the college email raul_zamban@estudante.sesisenai.org.br.

thanks!
